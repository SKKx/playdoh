        <h1>Playdoh: pure Python library for distributed computing and optimization </h1>

<p>Playdoh is a pure Python library for distributing computations across the 
free computing units (CPUs and GPUs) available in a small network of 
multicore computers. Playdoh supports independent (embarassingly) parallel 
problems as well as loosely coupled tasks such as global optimizations, 
Monte Carlo simulations and numerical integration of partial differential 
equations. It is designed to be <em>lightweight</em> and <em>easy-to-use</em> and should 
be of interest to scientists wanting to turn their lab computers into a 
small cluster at no cost.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Standalone, lightweight, easy-to-use pure Python library</strong> for 
small-scale distributed scientific computing</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parallel/distributed version of <code>map</code></strong>: call any Python function 
with different parameters in parallel over different CPUs/computers 
interconnected within a standard Ethernet network</p>

<pre><code>import playdoh
result = playdoh.map(lambda x: x * x, [1, 2], cpu=2)  # result == [1, 4]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Built-in support for GPU through PyCUDA</strong>: if you provide the 
PyCUDA/CUDA code, Playdoh can run it on several GPUs (on one or more 
computers) in parallel</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Built-in distributed optimization toolbox</strong>: you provide an 
objective Python function, and Playdoh will minimize or maximize it in 
parallel over several CPUs/computers (or GPUs if you give the 
PyCUDA/CUDA code) using a particle-based gradient-free optimization 
algorithm (CMA-ES, Genetic Algorithms or Particle Swarm Optimization 
algorithm)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple coarse-grained distributed computing interface</strong>: you can 
distribute your computations into loosely-coupled tasks and run them in 
parallel over CPUs and computers, inter-node communication happening 
through blocking FIFO tubes exposing a straightforward push/pull 
interface (examples include distributed PDE solvers, cellular automata, 
Monte Carlo simulators, optimizations...)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code handling</strong>: Playdoh handles the transport of your Python code 
between machines</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resources sharing</strong>: specify how many CPUs you dedicate to others' 
computations and how many you keep for yourself</p></li>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Parallel computing is now an essential paradigm for high performance 
scientific computing. Most existing hardware and software solutions are 
expensive or difficult to use. We developed Playdoh, a Python library for 
distributing computations across the free computing units available in a 
small network of multicore computers. Playdoh supports independent and 
loosely coupled parallel problems such as global optimisations, Monte 
Carlo simulations and numerical integration of partial differential 
equations. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use and should be 
of interest to scientists wanting to turn their lab computers into a small 
cluster at no cost.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>Playdoh is an open-source project and anyone is welcome to contribute to 
the project. Here are some info about the source code.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There's a unit testing suite in the <code>test</code> directory, it can be 
launched with the <code>test.py</code> script.</p></li>
<li><p>A document explaining how to add new features to Playdoh (like a new 
optimization algorithm) will be available soon.</p></li>
<li><p>A document explaining the internal implementation details of Playdoh 
will be available soon, it will be the starting point if you want to 
contribute to the code.</p></li>
<li><p>You can submit issues, ideas, comments on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/playdoh-library">Playdoh Google group</a>.</p></li>
